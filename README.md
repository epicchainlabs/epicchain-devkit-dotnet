## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- .NET SDK 6.0 or higher
- Visual Studio or any .NET-supported IDE

### Installation via NuGet
Install the package directly using NuGet:

```bash
dotnet add package EpicChain.DevKit.DotNet
```

Alternatively, in the Visual Studio Package Manager Console:

```bash
Install-Package EpicChain.DevKit.DotNet
```

### Manual Installation
Clone the repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/epicchain/epicchain-devkit-dotnet.git
cd epicchain-devkit-dotnet
dotnet build
```

---

## 👩‍💻 Getting Started

Follow the steps below to start building your EpicChain-based .NET applications.

1. **Create a New Project:**

```bash
dotnet new console -n EpicChainApp
cd EpicChainApp
```

2. **Add EpicChain DevKit:**

```bash
dotnet add package EpicChain.DevKit.DotNet
```

3. **Initialize the EpicChain SDK:**

```csharp
using EpicChain.DevKit;

var sdk = new EpicChainSDK();
sdk.Connect("https://node.epic-chain.org");
```

4. **Deploy Your First Smart Contract:**

```csharp
var contract = sdk.DeploySmartContract("YourSmartContract");
```

5. **Interact with EpicChain Blockchain:**

```csharp
var blockInfo = sdk.GetBlockInfo(123456);
Console.WriteLine($"Block Hash: {blockInfo.Hash}");
```

---

## 🛠️ Usage

### Basic Blockchain Queries
You can easily interact with the blockchain and query block data or account information using the SDK:

```csharp
var accountInfo = sdk.GetAccountInfo("YourEpicChainAddress");
Console.WriteLine($"Account Balance: {accountInfo.Balance}");
```

### Sending Transactions
You can send EpicChain native tokens from one wallet to another:

```csharp
var transaction = sdk.SendTransaction("FromAddress", "ToAddress", amount);
Console.WriteLine($"Transaction Hash: {transaction.Hash}");
```

---

## 🔨 Smart Contract Development

EpicChain DevKit allows you to create and deploy smart contracts written in C#. Here’s an example of a basic contract structure:

```csharp
using EpicChain.SmartContracts;

public class MyEpicContract : SmartContract
{
    public void Transfer(string to, int amount)
    {
        // Contract logic
    }
}
```

### Deploying the Contract
After writing your contract, deploy it using the SDK:

```csharp
var contractAddress = sdk.DeploySmartContract("MyEpicContract");
Console.WriteLine($"Contract deployed at: {contractAddress}");
```

### Interacting with the Contract
Invoke contract methods with the SDK:

```csharp
var result = sdk.CallSmartContractMethod("MyEpicContractAddress", "Transfer", "toAddress", 100);
```

---

## 🔑 Wallet Integration

Manage your EpicChain wallet directly within your .NET applications:

```csharp
var wallet = sdk.CreateWallet();
Console.WriteLine($"New Wallet Address: {wallet.Address}");

var balance = sdk.GetWalletBalance(wallet.Address);
Console.WriteLine($"Wallet Balance: {balance}");
```

You can also send and receive tokens programmatically:

```csharp
sdk.SendTransaction(wallet.Address, "RecipientAddress", 50);
```
